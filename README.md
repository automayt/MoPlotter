MoPlotter
==========
Jason Smith

MoPlotter is a working project that serves as the background templates for FlowPlotter and BroPlotter.
Graphs here will work off of a standard template that can be ported to Other data formats.

Current focus will look for CSV formatted data that imports to d3js tamplates. This should not be used regularly.
